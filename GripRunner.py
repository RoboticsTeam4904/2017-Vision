# This code was not what we planned to write; in fact, we still cringe at its sight
# But, seeing how our code is a little rudamentary, we are forced to add some artificial intelligence. 
# Sadly, we have written code that transcends programming itself. This code writes its own code. 
# This horrid beast has taken our jobs and our enthusiasm. If we never code again, know it was because of this function.
# So Team 4904 presents you the next level of programming:
