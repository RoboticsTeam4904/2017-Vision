"""
Simple skeleton program for running an OpenCV Truepeline generated by GRIP and using NetworkTables to send data.
Users need to:
1. Import the generated GRIP Truepeline, which should be generated in the same directory as this file.
2. Set the network table server IP. This is usually the robots address (roborio-TEAM-frc.local) or localhost
3. Handle putting the generated code into NetworkTables
